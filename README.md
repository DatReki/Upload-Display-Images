# Upload & display images
This is a simple example application that allows you to upload files, which then get embedded on the same page using base64.

Simply open the .html file in a browser or use [live server](https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server) and drag some files into the drop zone.

When using Firefox, depending on the files you upload, there might be a chance you run into the `Invalid URI. Load of media resource` warning. This is why this repo was originally created. To investigate that warning and why it's being caused.
